# Stream Sit Extension

Because Chrome does not allow normal websites to request Desktop streams, we
needed to build a Chrome extension to forward the `chrome.desktopCapture` API calls.

## Testing locally

Open Chrome, go to `chrome://extensions`, load unpacked extension.

## Deploying

It's been a while, so I forgot, I think you should refresh yourself via
https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted

1. Build the packed extension.
